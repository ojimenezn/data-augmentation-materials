# Dimensionless Descriptors for Materials Informatics
MATLAB implementation of Buckingham Pi method for generating dimensionless features for applications in Materials Informatics. Code was originally written for use with [MAGPIE (Materials Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration) dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjcompumats201628?report=reader).
