# dimensionless-descriptors
MATLAB implementation of Buckingham Pi method for generating dimensionless features for applications in Materials Informatics. Code was originally written for use with MAGPIE (Materials Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration) dataset (https://www.nature.com/articles/npjcompumats201628?report=reader). 

This code was written as part of a Summer REU Program working with Prof. Dane Morgan from UW-Madison (https://matmodel.engr.wisc.edu) in 2019.
